<p>
You should have X amount of districts, amount of people for those districts should be equal
So we have a grid of units. Every unit A-people voted for your candidate and B-people voted for another candidate.
Your mission is to unite all of those units in X amount of districts so your candidate would have more districts voted for him.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. Amount of people for each district (as integer) , grid of all electoral zone (as list of list (each unit has [A-peoples, B-peoples]))
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> united districts (as List of string). The same letters of string represents the same district. If your candidate can not win more, return empty list([]).
